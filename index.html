    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website. I learned how to code many years ago, but life moved on and technology changed faster than I expected.
      Now, I’m restarting my learning journey with fresh eyes and a curious mindset, working to catch up with today’s modern and AI-driven world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is my space to relearn, practice, experiment, and slowly rebuild my skills step by step.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m someone who has always been interested in technology and problem-solving. Although I have prior experience with coding,
      it has been a long time, and much has changed since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I’m focusing on refreshing the basics, learning modern tools, and understanding how AI is shaping the future of software and everyday life.
      This site reflects my belief that it’s never too late to learn, adapt, and grow.
